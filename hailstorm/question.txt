Following is called the hailstone sequence

n=n/2, if n is even
n=3n+1, if n is odd
n=1, stop

Starting with n=10

10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

len = 6

Which n < 1 000 000 produces the longest chain

Sol'n

n = 837799
len = 525


Don't ask me to try it in C or Java, that is cruel and unusual punishment
